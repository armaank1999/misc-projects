Practice with computational methods that are mentioned (especially in CS170) but never implemented in the class/used from libraries

Yes this in Java right now, later maybe do all the non BigInt stuff and move it all to C to take advantage of 61Crets and fast runtime so it's more applicable, but want to get the algorithm itself down first
